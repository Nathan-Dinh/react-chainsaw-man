        <p>
          Tatsuki Fujimoto (藤本 タツキ born October 10, 1993) is a currently
          active mangaka best known for Fire Punch and Chainsaw Man. Fujimoto's
          works are noted for referencing his love of movies, a distinctively
          "scratchy" artstyle with high levels of detail, and writing rich
          worlds with distinctive characters. They're also well-known for having
          a commonality of existential dread and nihilistic despair... and yet a
          surprising amount of hope when faced against such overwhelming odds
          and sadness.
