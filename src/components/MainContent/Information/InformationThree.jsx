              Asa Mitaka is an introverted high school student attending Fourth
              East High School, who has trouble finding her place in society
              following her mother's death to the Typhoon Devil. One day, after
              accidentally killing her class' pet devil Bucky, she is confronted
              by a student who has made a contract with the Justice Devil. The
              student attempts to kill Asa, but Yoru the War Devil appears and
              makes a contract with Asa, inhabting her body and making her a
              living Fiend host, under the condition that she kills Chainsaw
              Man. After dispatching her killer, Asa seeks to find Chainsaw Man,
              though she and Yoru have differing goals: Asa wants Yoru to leave
              her body, while Yoru wants to reclaim the Nuclear Weapons Devil
              which was consumed by Pochita. They join the school's Devil Hunter
              Club, where they are partnered with Yoshida and Yuko, an outgoing
              student who becomes friends with her.

              Meanwhile, Denji has adapted to his new life as a normal high
              school student, also attending Fourth East, while using his
              newfound fame as Chainsaw Man to attract women. Yoshida keeps tabs
              on him under an unknown mission. Knowing that Denji is desperate
              for a girlfriend, Yoshida introduces Denji to Asa, who attempts to
              reveal to her that he is Chainsaw Man, but fails.

              Asa later discovers that Yuko formed a contract with the Justice
              Devil and plans on enacting revenge on everyone who bullied Asa.
              Using Yoru's devil abilities, Asa confronts her, but accidentally
              slices Yuko into several pieces. At that moment, "Yoru's sister"
              appears and revives Yuko, turning her into a giant devil rampaging
              through the school. Denji attacks devil Yuko, but she escapes. The
              now-disfigured Yuko bids farewell to Asa and goes on the run for
              help, but a mysterious second Chainsaw Man dispatches her.

              Following the incident, Asa and Yoru meets Haruka Iseumi, the
              President of both the Devil Hunter's Club and the student council,
              who has taken interest in her. "Yoru's sister" also reveals
              herself to be the Famine Devil named Fami who's also a devil
              hunter club member. Haruka tells Yoru that he is Chainsaw Man,
              showing her a starting cord attached to his chest as proof.
              Seemingly convinced, Asa starts a relationship with Denji in hopes
              of using him as a weapon against Chainsaw Man, unaware of his true
              nature.
