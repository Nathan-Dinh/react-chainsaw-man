              Denji is a young man trapped in poverty, working off his deceased
              father's debt to the yakuza by working as a Devil Hunter, aided by
              Pochita, his canine companion and Chainsaw Devil. Denji is
              betrayed by the yakuza, who kill him for a contract with the
              Zombie Devil. Pochita makes a contract with Denji, merging with
              him as a human-devil Hybrid, under the condition that Denji shows
              his dreams to Pochita. Denji massacres the yakuza, and is
              approached by a team of governmental Devil Hunters, the Public
              Safety Division, led by Makima, who persuades him to join their
              ranks. Agreeing, Denji is partnered with Power, the Blood Fiend,
              and Aki Hayakawa, a self-destructive Devil Hunter. Makima promises
              Denji any favor, provided he kill the Gun Devil, perpetrator of
              the greatest massacre in human history.

              Several missions later, Denji's group encounters another hybrid,
              the Katana Man, a vengeful yakuza seemingly allied with the Gun
              Devil, attacks the Division. Makima and devil hunter Kobeni
              Higashiyama managed to repel the yakuza, but they lost a great
              portion of the Division, including Aki's partner Himeno. In order
              to match them, Denji and Power are trained by Kishibe, a master
              Devil-hunter who distrusts Makima; Aki makes a deal with the
              Future Devil, who foresees a "horrible death" for him. The
              Division launches a counter-attack against the Katana Man,
              capturing him. Some time later, Denji meets and begins a romance
              with a woman named Reze, who is actually the Bomb Devil, a Hybrid
              spy for the Soviet Union, sent to capture him. Though returning
              his affection, she attacks the city, with the Division barely
              saving Denji. After recovering, Denji fights her, and accepts a
              proposal to leave Japan together; before they can reunite, Makima
              secretly captures her, though her true motivation remains unknown.
              Denji's fight with Bomb Devil reveals his existence to the world.

              Foreign assassin groups target Denji: Chinese hunter and Kishibe's
              former partner, Quanxi; a mysterious enemy of Makima called "Santa
              Claus"; three American brothers; and a Russian woman teaching a
              pupil, Tolka. Denji is outfitted with a security detail including
              Hirofumi Yoshida, a Private Sector Devil Hunter contracting the
              Octopus Devil. Though the brothers are repelled, and Quanxi
              initially stalls, Santa Claus uses their Doll Devil powers for a
              large horde attack. After a follow-up by Quanxi, Tolka's master
              reveals herself as the true "Santa Claus", and has all parties
              transported to Hell, where they are attacked by the Darkness
              Devil. Santa Claus makes a contract with the Darkness Devil that
              empowers her. Makima retrieves the group from Hell, and Quanxi
              (who is revealed to be a hybrid) helps Denji defeat Santa Claus;
              Makima dispatches her afterwards. Following the incident, several
              devil hunters resigns, including Kobeni.

              After Denji recovers, Makima reveals the Gun Devil is actually a
              geopolitical asset, with many factions controlling pieces of it.
              As Aki begs Makima for Denji's safety, the president of the United
              States orders the Gun Devil to attack Japan and kill Makima.
              Revealed to be the Control Devil, Makima confronts the Gun Devil
              and wins. Aki dies in the attack, and the Gun Devil takes his body
              as a Fiend. Denji is attacked by the Gun Fiend, and, helped by
              civilians, kills it; Aki's death devastates him. While seemingly
              consoling him, Makima kills Power, revealing herself responsible
              for Denji's losses, having plotted to void his contract with
              Pochita by crushing his dreams of a normal life.

              Kishibe attacks her, and she calls for "Chainsaw Man" to save her.
              Controlling Denji's body, Pochita assumes his true form and runs,
              taking Kobeni with him. Makima explains her goals: to use
              Pochita's power to eliminate concepts from reality to create a
              world without suffering; to this end, she was empowered by the
              government with immortality. Fighting the Chainsaw Man using the
              brainwashed Hybrids, which include Katana Man, Reze, and Quanxi,
              she wins, as Denji's heroic deeds have weakened Pochita who saves
              Kobeni. However, Power revives as the Blood Devil from a remnant
              of her blood from Denji, escapes with Chainsaw Man, and, mortally
              wounded, restores Denji's will to live, having him promise to find
              her when she is reborn in Hell.

              Invigorated by public support for him, Denji confronts Makima for
              one last time and defeats her; to bypass her immortality, he eats
              her body. Later, Kishibe reveals the Control Devil resurfaced in
              the form of a little girl, now named Nayuta. He asks Denji to look
              after her, and Pochita supports this mission in Denji's dreams.
              Later, Denji enrolls in high school and continues fighting devils
              under the public eye.
