              Chainsaw Man (Japanese: チェンソーマン, Hepburn: Chensō Man) is a
              Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tatsuki Fujimoto.
              Its first part was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine
              Weekly Shōnen Jump from December 2018 to December 2020; its second
              part began serialization in Shueisha's Shōnen Jump+ online
              magazine in July 2022. Its chapters have been collected in 12
              tankōbon volumes as of October 2022. Chainsaw Man follows the
              story of Denji, an impoverished young man who makes a contract
              that fuses his body with that of a dog-like devil named Pochita,
              granting him the ability to transform parts of his body into
              chainsaws. Denji eventually joins the Public Safety Devil Hunters,
              a government agency focused on fighting against devils whenever
              they become a threat to Japan. The second arc of the story focuses
              on Asa Mitaka, a high school student who goes in a contract with
              Yoru the War Devil, who forces her to hunt down Chainsaw Man in
              order to reclaim the devils stolen from her. In North America, the
              manga is licensed in English by Viz Media, for both print and
              digital release, and it is also published by Shueisha on the Manga
              Plus online platform. An anime television series adaptation
              produced by MAPPA premiered in October 2022. As of November 2022,
              the manga had over 20 million copies in circulation, making it one
              of the best-selling manga series. In 2021, it won the 66th
              Shogakukan Manga Award in the shōnen category and won the Harvey
              Awards in the Best Manga category in 2021 and 2022. Chainsaw Man
              has been overall well received by critics, who have commended its
              storytelling, characters, dark humor and have particularly
              highlighted its violent scenes within the context of the story.

            <h1>Setting</h1>
            <p>
              The story is set in a world where Devils (悪魔, Akuma) are born
              from human fears. Devils are usually dangerous and malevolent,
              their power is proportional to the fear they incite. However,
              humans can form contracts with them to use their power, and there
              are individuals specializing in hunting and employing them, called
              Devil Hunters (デビルハンター, Debiru Hantā). Devils originate
              from Hell, and exist in a cycle between Earth and Hell: they
              migrate to Earth when killed in Hell, and vice versa. Dwelling in
              Hell are extremely powerful Devils called Primal Fears, which have
              never been killed. Transit between planes appears to be overseen
              by the Hell Devil (地獄の悪魔, Jigoku no Akuma). A Devil may, in
              certain conditions, inhabit the body of a dead human, gaining some
              of their memories and personality; such a creature is called a
              Fiend (魔人, Majin, lit. Demonic Person). In rare cases, a living
              Fiend Host is possible where the dead human is able to retain
              their personality and balance control of the body with their
              inhabitant, who they are able to directly converse with. Devils
              who naturally have a humanoid form are said to be benevolent to
              humans. The events of the story take place in 1997, in an
              alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, and many
              events such as the Holocaust, AIDS and nuclear weapons are
              revealed to have been erased from history and have ceased to exist
              entirely due to the consumption of their respective Devils by the
              Chainsaw Devil, with only a powerful group of devils known as the
              Four Horsemen remembering the original events. Likewise, there has
              been no war since the First World War as the War Devil has been
              weakened to the point that the only traces of war exist in pop
              culture and media.

            <h1>Production</h1>
            <p>
              Despite the series' violence and dark humor, Tatsuki Fujimoto
              always wanted to serialize in Weekly Shōnen Jump, but he had the
              feeling that his work would be "buried" if he had made a
              "Jump-like manga", so he tried to retain much of his individuality
              as a creator while making only the structure and characters
              Jump-like. Fujimoto also said that, despite its success in the
              magazine, he wanted to write the second part of the series on
              Shōnen Jump+, because he wanted to do a completely different
              series from the first part. According to him, there is not much of
              a difference in working between Weekly Shōnen Jump and Shōnen
              Jump+, explaining that there were a few depictions that got
              stopped during the rough draft stage, but he was allowed to do
              anything he wanted regarding the logic of the story.[5] Fujimoto
              said that he took inspiration from various works. During the
              serialization of Chainsaw Man, Fujimoto said that he was too busy,
              but he watched as many new things as he could and borrowed various
              elements from what he saw.[5] On Twitter, he stated that he was a
              fan of the 2016 film trilogy Kizumonogatari, and that the
              trilogy's final battle, shown in Part 3: Reiketsu, inspired the
              final battle of the first part of Chainsaw Man.[6] He also
              described the series as a "wicked FLCL" and a "pop Abara."[7]
              Fujimoto had various elements from the series planned from the
              beginning, while other things were added as it progressed. He did
              not have specific plans to bring payoff to the meaningful-sounding
              words and things that felt "off", adding that he left various
              things vague to make the series' second part easier to do.[5]
              Regarding the anime adaptation of the series, Fujimoto stated that
              he talked to the people handling it and he was comfortable leaving
              things to them.[5] When the anime series was officially announced,
              Fujimoto commented: "Chainsaw Man is like a copycat of Dorohedoro
              and Jujutsu Kaisen, and the studio of Dorohedoro and Jujutsu
              Kaisen will produce its anime!? I have nothing to say! Please do
              it!"[8] According to the manga's editor, Shihei Lin, Fujimoto is
              heavily involved in the production of the anime series, stating:
              "Fujimoto-san has seen all the Chainsaw Man's pitch documents,
              story structure, scripts, and even the storyboards. He has
              continued to be in close contact with MAPPA's anime team." MAPPA
              producer, Makoto Kimura, also commented that Fujimoto involvement
              extended to the casting, planning, and music, because the staff
              wanted the anime to capture as much of the manga's original vision
              as possible, including the violence and gore. MAPPA approached
              Shueisha with the pitch for the project.[9]
